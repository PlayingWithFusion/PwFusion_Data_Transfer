* ADDITIONAL NOTES:
* This file contains functions to initialize and run a Playing With Fusion R3aktor in
* order to communicate with the I2C Joystick board. Funcionality is as described below:
*	- Configure R3aktor to receive information from the I2C Joystick board using the
*   PwFusion_Data_Transfer library
*	- Broadcast results to COM port
*  Circuit: (see Schematic.png)
*    R3aktor     -->  I2C Joystick
*    Qwiic pins  -->  Qwiic pins
