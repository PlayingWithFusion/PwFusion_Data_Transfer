This library is mainly utilized in conjunction with the other Playing with Fusion libraries for the interface (IFB-4xxxx) boards to simplify the transfer of information over I2C.
These examples showcase how this Data Transfer library can be used instead of using the libraries for the specific boards.
Note: It is recommended to use the board-specific libraries for your applications (ex: use PwFusion_Encoder for the rotary encoder I2C board)
